# Internal Ant properties

DITA-OT uses these Ant properties in certain internal operations. They are not intended for general use, but may be adjusted by plug-in developers to configure custom transform types.

**Attention:** Internal properties are subject to change from one version of DITA-OT to another.

-   **`include.rellinks`**

    A space-separated list of link roles to be output; the `#default` value token represents links without an explicit role \(those for which no `@role` attribute is defined\). Defined by `args.rellinks`, but may be overridden directly.

    Valid roles include:

    -   parent
    -   child
    -   sibling
    -   friend
    -   next
    -   previous
    -   cousin
    -   ancestor
    -   descendant
    -   sample
    -   external
    -   other
-   **`temp.output.dir.name`**

    This property can be used to place all output in an internal directory, so that a final step in the transform type can do some form of post-processing before the files are placed in the specified output directory.

    For example, if a custom HTML5 transform sets the property to `zip_dir`, all output files \(including HTML, images, and CSS\) will be placed within the directory `zip_dir` in the temporary processing directory. A final step can then be used to add more files, zip the directory, and return that zip to the designated output directory.
